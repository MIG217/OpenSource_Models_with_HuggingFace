## Natural Language Processing

### NLP Task

#### 💡 Function

A simple chatbot that generates responses to user input using a pretrained NLP model.

#### 🧠 Model

- **Model Name**: `facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill`
- **Model Type**: A text generation model based on the **Transformer** architecture
- **Source**: Developed by Meta (Facebook), part of the BlenderBot series, and distilled to improve inference efficiency
- **URL**: https://huggingface.co/facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill

#### 🔁 Input and Output

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Input** | A user message in natural language (e.g., *"What are some fun activities I can do in the winter?"*) |
| **Output** | A natural language response generated by the model (e.g., *"You could try skiing, snowboarding, or building a snowman!"*) |

### Translation

#### 💡 Function

Translates text from one language to another using a pretrained NLP model.

#### 🧠 Model

- **Model Name**: `facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M`
- **Model Type**: A multilingual machine translation model based on the Transformer architecture
- **Source**: Developed by Meta (Facebook), part of the No Language Left Behind (NLLB) project, distilled for efficiency
- **URL**: https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M

#### 🔁 Input and Output

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Input** | A sentence in a source language (e.g., *"Bonjour, comment ça va?"*) |
| **Output** | The translated sentence in the target language (e.g., *"Hello, how are you?"*) |


### Summarization

#### 💡 Function

Generates a concise summary of a longer text using a pretrained NLP model.

#### 🧠 Model

- **Model Name**: `facebook/bart-large-cnn`
- **Model Type**: A sequence-to-sequence text summarization model based on the Transformer architecture (specifically the BART model)
- **Source**: Developed by Meta (Facebook), fine-tuned for summarization on the CNN/DailyMail dataset
- **URL**: https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn

#### 🔁 Input and Output

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Input** | A long piece of text or article |
| **Output** | A concise, human-readable summary of the input |

### Sentence Embeddings

### 🧷 Sentence Embedding

#### 💡 Function

Generates dense vector representations (embeddings) of sentences for downstream tasks like similarity comparison or semantic search.

#### 🧠 Model

- **Model Name**: (uses models from the `sentence-transformers` library, such as `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- **Model Type**: A sentence embedding model based on the **Transformer** architecture (e.g., BERT or its variants)
- **Source**: 
- **URL**: https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

#### 🔁 Input and Output

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Input** | One or more sentences in natural language (e.g., *"This is a sentence."*) |
| **Output** | A dense vector (embedding) representing the semantic content of the input sentence(s) |
